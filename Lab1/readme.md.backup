To use automatic deployment, one must have the Azure CLI (or alternatively, Azure PowerShell) installed. To log in to your account through the Azure CLI use the following command:

```


To use this ARM deployment template a resource group must have already been created. 

If no resource group has been created yet, then one may be created through the following Azure CLI command:
```
az group create 
--name <rgName> 
--location <location - eg. 'westeurope'>
```

```
az deployment group create 
--resource-group <rgName> 
--template-file "azuredeploy.json" 
--parameters "azuredeploy.parameters.json"
```

This template creates a Storage Account (Free Tier) as well as an Azure Web App (Free Tier).
